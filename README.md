# Data Analysis Using R
Repository for the lecture slides of the "Data Analysis using R (dauR)" course.

## Learning outcomes
The module aims to enable students to conduct their own empirical projects using the statistical software R. By the end of the module, the students will be 
equipped with the necessary skills to independently conduct and manage empirical projects outside of this course, such as a master thesis. Students will also learn how to use git repositories for version control and collaboration, preparing them for possible careers in data analytics after graduation. By presenting the results of the project to their fellow students, the students can further improve their skills in in scientific presentation and time management. 

## Content
The module is divided into two parts. In the first half of the semester, students learn the basics and core components of data analysis with R in a lecture. The 
lecture covers the most important steps of data analysis projects: from importing and preparing raw data, explorative data analysis and visualization, formulating the empirical model to communicating the results. Practical examples will show how these steps can be implemented using a set of R packages known as the tidyverse. In addition, it will be shown how to generate reports in R using the open-source scientific and technical publishing system Quarto. A special focus of the lecture is to introduce students to collaboration via version-controlled remote repositories. For this purpose, students will be shown how to create and manage a repository using GitHub. 

In the second half of the semester, students will work independently in groups on their own data analysis project. Based on the content of the lecture, a GitHub repository will be created in group work, which the students will use to prepare a data set and perform an econometric analysis. At the end of the semester, the students will share the results of their work in a presentation created with Quarto.
