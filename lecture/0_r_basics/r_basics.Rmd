## What is R?

> R is a free, not-commercial, open-source software language for statistical computing and graphics. It comes with a lot of advantages, especially for data analysis projects.

.pull-left.short-width[
.big-emoji[`r emo::ji("hatching")`]
]

.pull-right.long-width[
#### Origin
- `R` is based on the programming language `S` ('dialect of S'), which in turn is based on the core programming language `C`

- First version published by **R**oss Ihaka and **R**obert Gentlemen in 1993 (name is based on their first initials)

- Intention of `R`: creating an environment where one doesn't consciously think of programming

## Prerequisites 

#### Download the appropiate versions of R and RStudio for your operating system

- R can be downloaded via the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/)

- Best integrated development environment (IDE), i. e. where you write and compile your code, is RStudio and can be downloaded [here](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/)

## Basic Calculations

---

.pull-left.short-width[
.big-emoji[`r emo::ji("calculation")`]
]

.pull-right.long-width[
#### Math operators

- `+`: addition
- `-`: subtraction
- `*`: multiplication (elementwise!)
- `/`: division
- `^`: power operator (e.g. $2^3$)
]

--

.pull-left.short-width[
.big-emoji[`r emo::ji("developer")`]
]

.pull-right.long-width[
#### Commands

- `abs()`: absolute value
- `sqrt()`: square root
- `exp()`: exponential function
- `log()`: natural logarithm
- `factorial()`: factorial (e.g. 8!)
- `round( , digits = x)`: round to x digits
]

--

*Note:* These operations work on different types (e.g. scalars, vectors, matrices, ...)

---

```{r}
3 + 5 * 2
```

```{r}
(3 + 5) * 2
```

```{r}
sqrt(8.33)
```

```{r}
round(sqrt(8.33), 2)
```

*Caution:* Decimal numbers use a dot instead of a comma (convenient in the US and in the UK)

---

layout: false

## R-Scripts

- Within R there are several file types to create

- R-Scripts are simple text files (`<file_name>.R`) with a collection of commands (and comments)

- Useful to store and document your statistical analyses

- A new R-Script can be generated by clicking on `File > New File > R Script`

- Run code from R scripts by highlighting the code snippet and typing `Ctrl` + `Enter`

---

## Comments

- For better documentation, you can place comments in your R-Script using the symbol `#`

- Everything placed behind the `#` and belonging to the same line is treated as a comment

--

.pull-left[
```{r}
# Multiply two by five
2 * 5
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r}
10 / 4 # Divide ten by four
```
]

---

layout: true

## R-Packages

- R has a lot of built-in commands delivered by the installation of R

- Often, these built-in commands are not sufficient (or convenient) to conduct more complex statistical analyses

- Further commands can be used by installing specialized packages

---

---

.pull-left[
#### Installing

- Run `install.packages()` while your PC is connected to the internet

- Each package has to be installed **only once**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Installing the package rio
install.packages("rio")
```
]

--

.pull-right[
#### Loading

- If you want to use a command from a specific package you need to activate the package by running the command `library()`

- Packages need only to be activated **once per session**

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(rio)
```
]

---

layout: false

## Variables

.pull-left[
- Variables can take all kinds of different content (vectors, matrices, data sets, regression, ...)

- Variables are created by the assignment operator `<-`

- When variables are assigned, they are shown in RStudio's environment pane 

- Using `=` to assign variables is considered bad practice
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r}
# Assign value 4 to variable x
x <- 4

# Print x
x
```

```{r}
# Do some calculations with x
x * 2
```

```{r}
# Overwrite x
x <- 1
x
```
]

---

layout: false

## Vectors

- Vectors are the most important data type in R

- What we normally refer to as vector is an "atomic vector" in R: A vector of elements with the same type

  - Scalars in R are atomic vectors as well (length 1 vectors)

- R allows vectors to have elements of different types, a so-called "list"
  
  - More complex than atomic vectors: Each element can be **any** type
  
  - Elements can differ in length
  
  - May contain several atomic vectors of different lengths with different types
  
---

layout: true

## Atomic Vectors

.pull-left[
- Four primary types:

  1. **Logical**: `TRUE` or `FALSE`
  
  2. **Integer**: Whole numbers followed by `L`, e. g. `1234L`
  
  3. **Double**: Decimal number defined by the floating point standard, e. g. `0.1234`
  
  4. **Character**: Strings surrounded by `"` or `'`, e. g. `"this is a string"` or `'this as well'`

- Integers and doubles are numeric with unique values `Inf`, `-Inf` and `NaN` (not a number)

- Generate vectors with `c(1, 2, ...)`
]

---
---

.pull-right[
#### Operations

```{r}
# Generate x and z
x <- c(5, 1, 9, 3)
z <- c(4, 9, 0, 4)
```

```{r}
# Multiplication with scalar
2 * x
```

```{r}
# Elementwise multiplication
x * z
```
]

---

.pull-right[
#### Special Commands

```{r}
# vector with 5 ones
rep(1, 5)
```

```{r}
# sequence from 1 to 5
seq(1, 5)
```

```{r}
1:5
```
]

## Subsetting Vectors

---

.pull-left[
- Sometimes we want to work with specific elements from a vector

  1. Subset via element indices
  
  2. Subset via logicals

- Specific elements can be extracted by enclosing the index with `[` and `]`
]

---

.pull-left[
- Sometimes we want to work with specific elements from a vector

  1. **Subset via element indices**
  
  2. Subset via logicals

- Specific elements can be extracted by enclosing the index with `[` and `]`
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
# Elements 2
x[2]
```

```{r}
# Elements 1 to 3
x[1:3]
```

```{r}
# All elements except the last one
x[-4]
```
]

---

.pull-left[

]

.pull-right[
```{r}
# Subset with TRUE/FALSE
x[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)]
```
]

---

layout: false

## Factors

.pull-left[
- Vector that contains predefined values

- Used to represent categorical data

- Integer vectors with the following **attributes** (metadata of the vector):

  1. `class`: "factor"
  
  2. `levels`: Set of allowed values, sorted into increasing order

- Created by the `factor()` function

- Can be ordered when setting the `ordered` argument of `factor()` to `TRUE`
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r}
x <- factor(c("b", "a", "a", "b", "a"),
            levels = c("a", "b"))

class(x)

levels(x)
```
]

---

layout: false

## Missing Values

- R reserves `NA` for missing values ("not applicable")

.pull-left[
- Most computations with missing values return missing values
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
NA * 10
```
]

.pull-left[
- Exception: When identity holds for all inputs, for example when computing $x^0$
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
NA^0
```
]

.pull-left[
- Use `is.na()` to test for missing values
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
x <- c(1, NA, 2, 3)

is.na(x)
```
]

---

layout: true

## Matrices

.pull-left[
- Vectors can have **attributes** (some metadata of the vector)

- Adding the `dim` attribute to an atomic vector makes it a 2-dimensional matrix

- Can be created by assigning `dim()` to an atomic vector or simply calling `matrix()`

- Can also be created by binding atomic vectors with the same data type and length column-wise using `cbind()`or row-wise using `rbind()`
]

---
---

.pull-right[
```{r}
# Add dim attribute to atomic vector
x <- 1:6

dim(x) <- c(3, 2) # 3 rows, 2 columns

x
```
]

---

.pull-right[
```{r}
# Use the matrix command to create a
# matrix from a vector
matrix(x, nrow = 3)

# Specify ncol instead of nrow
matrix(x, ncol = 2)
```
]

---

.pull-right[
```{r}
# Fill matrix column-wise instead of
# row-wise
matrix(x, ncol = 2, byrow = T)
```
]

---

.pull-right[
```{r}
# Bind atomic vectors column-wise
cbind(1:3, 4:6)
```
]

---

layout: true

## Matrix Operations

.pull-left[
- `t()`: transpose

- `solve()`: inverse

- `%*%`: matrix multiplication
]

---

---

.pull-right[
```{r}
A <- matrix(c(1, 2, 0, 3), ncol = 2)

A

t(A)

solve(A)
```
]

---

.pull-right[
```{r}
B <- matrix(c(4, 7, 2, 6), ncol = 2)

B

A %*% B
```
]

---

layout: true

## Subsetting Matrices

.pull-left[
- Specific elements can be extracted using `[` and `]`

- To distinguish the row from the column positions, a comma is used within the brackets **`[row, column]`**
]

---

.pull-right[
```{r}
C <- matrix(-5:6, ncol = 4)

C
```
]

---

.pull-right[
```{r}
C[1, ]
```

```{r}
C[, 1:3]
```

```{r}
C[1:2, 2]
```
]

--

*Note:* Some of these commands can also be applied to matrices

---

layout: true

## Lists

.pull-left[
- Each element can be **any** type

- Can be constructed using `list()`

- Just like with atomic vectors, elements in a list can be named

- Subsetting lists is done via double brackets `[[` and `]]` or `$`
]

---

.pull-right[
```{r}
x <- list(1:5, "a", c(TRUE, FALSE),
          seq(0.2, 0.6, by = 0.2))

typeof(x)

x
```
]

---

.pull-right[
```{r}
x <- list(
  integer_vector = 1:5,
  character_vector = "a"
)

x
```
]

---

.pull-right[
```{r}
x$integer_vector

x[[1]]
```

]

---

layout: false

## Data Frames

.pull-left[
- Used when dealing with tabular data

- Essentially a named list of vectors with

  - **same length** of all elements
  
  - attributes for column **`names`** and **`row.names`**
  
  - and **"data.frame" as the `class`**
  
- Created using the `data.frame()` function
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r}
df <- data.frame(x = 1:10, y = letters[1:10])

df
```
]

---

layout: true

## Useful Commands

.pull-left[
- `View(df)`: Opens `df` in a spreadsheet-style data viewer in RStudio

- `summary(df)`: Produces summary statistics for each variable

- `df$x`: Access variable with name `x`

- `head(df)`: Shows first six rows of `df`

- `tail(df)`: Shows last six rows of `df`

- `nrow(df)`: Number of rows (observations)

- `ncol(df)`: Number of columns (variables)

- `names(df)`: Column names
]

---

---

.pull-right[
```{r}
summary(df)
```
]

---

.pull-right[
```{r}
df$x

## Working with Data Frames

---

.pull-left[
Create a new column:
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
df$z <- seq(0.1, 1, by = 0.1)

df
```
]

---

.pull-left[
Select multiple columns by name:
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
df[, c("x", "z")]
```
]

---

.pull-left[
Select a subset of observations based on a condition:

- `df$x <= 5` evaluates to a vector of logicals with same length as the atomic vector `df$x`

- Logical vector selects rows to keep when subsetting

- Can of course also subset using a vector of indices
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
df[df$x <= 5,]
```
]

---

layout: false

## Importing Data Sets

.pull-left[
- Data sets are usually stored in specific file formats such as `.csv`, `.xlsx` or Stata's `.dta`

- Base R offers functions for the most common data storage formats

- For some formats we have to use packages such as `haven` for `.dta` files (or write functions ourselves)

- Import the `.csv` file stored under `data/processed/happiness.csv`, data from `r Citet(bib, "introecon")`
]

.pull-right[
```{r eval=FALSE}
df <- read.csv("data/processed/happiness.csv")
```

```{r include=FALSE}
df <- read.csv(paste0(params$path_data, "processed/happiness.csv"))
```
]

---

## Note that...

... you can change the working directory by using the command  `setwd("YOUR_PATH")` (recommended!)

--

... you can also change the working directory by clicking on `Session > Set Working Directory > Choose Directory`

--

... as a rule, `R` accepts "`/`" but does not accept "`\`" (which is often used on german PCs)

--

... if your working directory is specified you do not need to set the whole path for future operations (only the relative path)

## Linear Regression Models in R

Let's build a linear probability model using the happiness data!

--

We are interested in analyzing how owning a gun has an effect on whether individuals see themselves as "very happy":

$$vhappy = \alpha + \beta_1 \times educ + \beta_2 \times income + \beta_3 \times owngun + \varepsilon,$$

where

- $vhappy=1$ if the individual is very happy

- $educ$: Years of schooling completed

- $income$: Income brackets

- $owngun=1$ if the individual owns a gun

---

## Inspect the Data

```{r}
summary(df[,c("vhappy", "educ", "income", "owngun")])
```

--

- Contains `NA` `r emo::ji("right arrow")` need to be removed for the estimation

--

- `income` and `owngun` are of type character `r emo::ji("right arrow")` transform columns to correct format

---

layout: true

## Clean the Data

---

Remove missing values using `na.omit()`:

```{r}
# Create a new data frame in the environment with a subset of columns used for the analysis
df_clean <- df[,c("vhappy", "educ", "income", "owngun")]

# Remove all rows containing NAs
df_clean <- na.omit(df_clean)

summary(df_clean)
```

---

Recode `owngun` to a dummy variable using `ifelse()`:

```{r}
# Recode owngun to a dummy variable
df_clean$owngun <- ifelse(df_clean$owngun == "yes", 1, 0)

summary(df_clean)
```

---

The `income` is given in the form of income brackets and stored as a character vector:

```{r}
# Take a look at unique values of the income
unique(df_clean$income)
```

--

`r emo::ji("right arrow")` Convert to factor

---

Convert `income` to an ordered factor:

```{r}
df_clean$income <- factor(df_clean$income,
                          levels = c(
                            "lt $1000", "$1000 to 2999", "$3000 to 3999", "$4000 to 4999",
                            "$5000 to 5999", "$6000 to 6999", "$7000 to 7999", "$8000 to 9999",
                            "$10000 - 14999", "$15000 - 19999", "$20000 - 24999", "$25000 or more"
                          ),
                          ordered = T)

summary(df_clean)
```

---

layout: true

## Linear Model: `lm()`

---

.pull-left[
- The function `lm()` is used to fit (multivariate) linear models

- For the model defined before, we simply need:

  1. `formula`: `vhappy ~ educ + income + owngun`
  
  2. `data`: The `df_clean` data frame we prepared
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
model <- lm(vhappy ~ educ + income + owngun,
            df_clean)
```

]

---

```{r}
model
```

---

layout: false

## Model Summary: `summary()`

.scroll-box-18[
```{r}
summary(model)
```
]

---

## Extract Coefficients: `coef()`

```{r}
coef(model)
```

---

layout: false

## Formulas

- Formulas have a special syntax in R and reference the column names given in the data

- LHS and RHS are separated by `~`
  
- Variables to be included in the model are separated by `+`
  
- R automatically assumes an intercept: To remove the intercept, add `-1` at the start or `+0` at the end of the RHS
  
- May include transformations of the data, e. g. `log()`

- `:` indicates interactions of variables

- `*` denotes factor crossings, i. e. `a*b` is the same as `a + b + a:b`

- `^` is used for polynomials, i. e. `a^2` translates to `a*a`

---
