##  Introduction

- Data analysis projects are typically conducted by a team of analysts

- Through team work in courses you may be used to storing your group work independently on your PCs and (when a group member finishes a task) send updated files to each other

- Especially when files are often revised, it becomes harder and harder to trace which file reflects the current state of your work

- The larger the group, the more work this kind of workflow means for each group member

- Version control systems such as Git help trace changes made to your files

---

## What is Git?

Git is a version control system used in particular in software development to **trace changes to the source code**. This way of working has been adopted by scientists in order to keep track of the countless changes to the multitude of files that exist within a project.

- Manages the evolution of a set of files in a so-called **repository** (or "repo")

- Data analysis projects are made up of a many files (data, scripts, figures, reports, ...)
  
  - Often subject to incremental changes
  - Using Git allows to track changes (and in the worst case undo mistakes like accidentally deleting a file)
  
- Allows for distributed development

  - Each collaborator has a local copy of the repository
  - Able to develop locally without an internet connection

# Installing Git

---

## Step 1: Register a GitHub Account

- Register a free GitHub account on <https://github.com/>

--

- Remarks on your username (in case you want to use your GitHub account for e. g. your resume):

  1. Use some variant of your actual name
  2. Do not include your current organization/employer
  3. Keep it short
  4. Use lower case only
  5. Use a hyphen `-` for word separation

---

## Step 2a: Install Git for Windows

- Git for Windows (`msysgit` or "Git Bash") can be downloaded from <https://gitforwindows.org/>
  
  - Contains Git and other useful tools such as the Bash shell

- Install Git
  
  - When asked about "Adjusting your PATH environment", select "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software"
  - Otherwise accept the defaults
  
---

## Step 2b: Install Git for macOS

#### Option 1

- Install Xcode command line tools

- Go to the shell and enter one of these commands to elicit an offer to install developer command line tools:

```{r eval=FALSE}
git --version
git config
```

- Accept the offer and “Install”

#### Option 2

Install Git from <http://git-scm.com/downloads>

---

## Step 3: Connect your GitHub account to Git

Start RStudio and connect your previously registered GitHub account to Git using the `usethis` package:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# If you do not have the package installed, run:
# install.packages("usethis")

# Replace user name and email with your GitHub user name and the
# email address you registered your account with!

library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name = "YOUR_NAME",
               user.email = "YOUR_MAIL@ruhr-uni-bochum.de")
```

---

layout: true

## Step 4: Set up your GitHub credentials

---

- In order to interact with GitHub (e. g. `pull` a repository or `push` some changes), we have to provide credentials

- For communication with the server, we can choose between two protocols, HTTPS and SSH

- For ease of use, we set up our credentials using HTTPS which requires a **personal access token (PAT)**

- We can do this easily in `R`

---

.pull-left[
- Use the `usethis` package to generate a PAT:

- Click "Generate token", copy the generated PAT and store the PAT where you can easily find it

- Next time you are asked for your password, give this PAT
]
.pull-right[
```{r eval=FALSE}
usethis::create_github_token()
```
]

---

.pull-left.short-width[
.big-emoji[`r emo::ji("information")`]
]

.pull-right.lo-wi[
You can store your PAT using the `gitcreds` package. `gitcreds_set()` will open a prompt, where you can paste your PAT:

```{r eval=FALSE}
gitcreds::gitcreds_set()

# Creating a New Repository

---

## Initializing a Repository

- There are different ways to set up a repository
  
  - Using Git from the shell
  - Using the `usethis` package
  - Via RStudio IDE

- The easiest way is to create a GitHub repository first, then an R project with version control via the RStudio IDE

# Creating Commits

---

## Make Changes to Your Repository

.pull-left[
- Your repository is now set up and running. Time to fill it with content!

- Let's do some regression analysis on the `mtcars` data set included in R:

  1. Create a new folder `analyses` inside your project directory
  2. Create an `.R` file with some content, e. g. regressing the gas consumption of cars (`mpg`) on the logarithm of their horsepower (`hp`) and the number of their cylinders (`cyl`)
  3. Save the content of the code on the right to an R file `regression_analysis.R` inside the `analyses` folder
  4. Commit your changes to your Git repository
]
.pull-right[
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Create a linear regression model
model <- lm(mpg ~ log(hp) + cyl,
            data = mtcars)

# Print a model summary for "model"
summary(model)
```
]

---

## What is a commit?

- A commit can be thought of as saving changes to your git repository

- Takes a snapshot of all modified files in the repository at the moment

- The difference in files between two commits is called a "diff"

- Each commit contains a commit message
  
  - Looking at the commit history makes it possible to track changes

- Commits are initially only local changes
  
  - To make commits available to collaborators, commits have to be "pushed" to the GitHub repository
  
---

layout: true

## Creating a Commit

RStudio's Git pane shows files that were modified, added or deleted. To save these changes to your repository, follow these steps:

---

.pull-left[
- Select files to commit
]
.pull-right[
```{r out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(params$path_assets, "commit_1.png"))
```
]

---

.pull-left[
- Click on "Commit" in the Git pane
]
.pull-right[
```{r out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(params$path_assets, "commit_2.png"))
```
]

---

.pull-left[
- Type a brief commit message and click on "Commit"
]
.pull-right[
```{r out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(params$path_assets, "commit_3.png"))
```
]

---

layout: false

## Commit Messages

- In software development, a commit is often done when finishing a unit of work (e. g. writing a function that lets you retrieve some data)

- Not feasible for data analysis projects
  
  - What would a unit of work be in a data analysis?

- Best to think of commit messages as logging work done
  
  - Does not have to be finished
  - It helps to log work-in-progress (e. g. when finishing for today)
  
---

layout: false

## Best Practices

There is no "one way" of writing commit messages but they have to be **consistent** and **informative**!

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line

2. Keep the subject line as short as possible

3. Do not end the subject line with a period

4. Use imperatives for the subject line

5. Use the body to explain *what* and *why* vs. *how*

## Pushing Commits

We have changed our local directory by adding files and made a commit to our Git repository. Let's share our code by pushing our commit to the GitHub repository!

---

---

.pull-left[
- "Pull" to check whether the local repository is up to date

- While you were working on problem X, your collaborators might have already pushed their solution to problem Y
]
.pull-right[
```{r out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(params$path_assets, "push_1.png"))
```
]

---

.pull-left[
- "Push" your commit(s) to the remote GitHub repository
]
.pull-right[
```{r out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(params$path_assets, "push_2.png"))
```
]

---

.pull-left[
- Go to your GitHub repository

- The new files should now be visible

# Working with Feature Branches

---

## Branches

.pull-left[
- Creating a branch means detouring from the main development branch and working on feature without changing the state of the main stream

  - Allows for **parallel development** streams because collaborators don't overwrite each other's code
  - Useful for single-authored repositories to experiment with different problem solving strategies

- Working directly on the main branch is generally considered bad practice

  - Would require to constantly incorporate code changes by your collaborators
  - Leads to conflicting code when working on the same branch
]
.pull-right[
```{r out.width = "50%", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(params$path_assets, "branch_model.png"))
```
]

---

## Issues

.pull-left[
- The scope of development on a feature branch should always be outlined beforehand (and maybe adjusted later on)
  
  - Think about *what*, *why* and (to some extent) *how* you want to achieve something before writing your code
  - Don't develop something for the sake of writing code

- GitHub offers an easy to use feature for documenting the scope of a feature branch: Issues

- Issues are shown in the "Issues" tab of your repository and can be assigned to GitHub projects
]
.pull-right[
```{r out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(params$path_assets, "issue.png"))
```
]

---

## GitHub Projects

.pull-left[
- Another great feature of GitHub is the project management tool

- You can organize and manage your repository using GitHub projects

- Create a project for your repository in the "Projects" tabs

- Give your project a concise and descriptive name

- The "Team backlog" template is best suited for your needs
]
.pull-right[
```{r out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(params$path_assets, "create_github_project.png"))
```
]

---

## Managing Your Project

.pull-left[
- The default team backlog has the following cards representing different statuses:

  1. **New:** Shows all newly created issues in your project
  2. **Backlog:** Collect all your issues that are not yet ready for development in the backlog
  3. **Ready:** Drag issues that are ready to develop from "Backlog" to "Ready"
  4. **In progress:** When you begin the development of a feature described in an issue, drag the corresponding issue to the "In progress" card
  5. **In review:** When you are done developing the feature, it is good practice to let others review your code
  6. **Done:** Feature that have gone through the review process are set to the status "Done"
]
.pull-right[
```{r out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(params$path_assets, "github_project.png"))
```
]

---

## Linking Feature Branches and Issues

.pull-left[
- Issues can be linked to feature branches by creating a branch on the issue page

- Branches can also be created directly in RStudio by clicking on the purple symbol on the right of the Git pane

- Linking issues to branches is the better approach when you are already documenting the scope of a feature branch in issues and use GitHub projects to manage your repository
]
.pull-right[
```{r out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(params$path_assets, "issue_branch.png"))
```
]

---

## Checkout Branches

.pull-left[
- To change the branch you are working on in RStudio, click on the dropdown right to the symbol for creating a new branch in the Git pane

- You have to pull (blue arrow) the remote repository before the newly created feature branch appears in RStudio
]
.pull-right[
```{r out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(params$path_assets, "checkout_branch.png"))
```
]

---

## Commit and Push

.pull-left[
- Let's implement what we outlined in the issue and estimate two specifications of our linear regression model:
  
  1. $mpg=\alpha+\beta_1hp+\beta_2cyl+\varepsilon$
  2. $mpg=\alpha+\beta_1\log{hp}+\beta_2cyl+\varepsilon$

- Commit your changes and push the commit to the repository
]
.pull-right[
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Create list of specifications
formulas <- list(
  model_1 = formula(mpg ~ hp + cyl),
  model_2 = formula(mpg ~ log(hp) + cyl)
)

# Estimate each formula in formulas
models <- lapply(formulas,
                 lm,
                 data = mtcars)

# Print model summaries
lapply(models, summary)
```
]

---

class: middle

# Pull Requests

---

layout: true

## Creating a Pull Request

---

.pull-left[
- The process of merging the feature branch into the main branch is called **pull request**

- After pushing your commit to the repository, GitHub conveniantly asks whether you want to create a pull request
]
.pull-right[
```{r out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(params$path_assets, "pull_request_1.png"))
```
]

---

.pull-left[
- Open a pull request and assign it to you

- Assign a reviewer and specify the project

- If there is only one commit on the feature branch, GitHub automatically fills subject line and body for you

  - Otherwise give a concise but descriptive subjet line and note what was done
  - Use closing keywords to automatically close the issue when the branch is merged (e. g. "Closes #1" for issue number 1)
  
- Don't fortget to change the issue status to "In review"
]
.pull-right[
```{r out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(params$path_assets, "pull_request_2.png"))
```
]

---

layout: false

## Inspect Pull Requests

- Once the pull request was created, it will be displayed in the "Pull requests" tab of your repository until the feature branch was successfully merged into the main branch

- Creating a pull request automatically creates a task in your project that you can track

- Your reviewers can inspect your commits and write comments as well as make suggestions for code changes

- If all requirements for the feature were met, the reviewer can approve the pull request

- The feature branch can then be merged into the main branch by clicking on "Merge pull request"

---

## Setting Issues on "Done"

.pull-left[
- After merging the feature branch into the main branch, the feature branch can be safely deleted

- Because closing keywords were used, both, the issue and the pull request, were automatically set to "Done" in your repository after merging the feature
]
.pull-right[
```{r out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(params$path_assets, "pull_request_3.png"))
```

# Resolving Merge Conflicts

---

## Merge Conflicts

- Sometimes, Git identifies competing code lines, e. g. when two persons edit the same lane on two different branches

- Merge conflicts are often a hassle but (if you know what to do) are fairly easy to resolve

--

.pull-left.short-width[
.big-emoji[`r emo::ji("warning")`]
]

.pull-right.lo-wi[
Just keep a cool head and do not start doing anything in hope of magically resolving the merge conflict!
]

---

## Resolving Merge Conflicts Using the Terminal

1. Navigate to the terminal in RStudio (the tab next to the console)

2. Get a list of files responsible for the merge conflict by running `git status` in the terminal

3. Open the files listed as "both modified". Conflicting lines are marked by `<<<<<<<` and separated by `=======`.

  - The base branch is marked as `<<<<<<< HEAD`
  - The code line on the other branch is followed by `>>>>>>> BRANCH-NAME`
  - Adjust the code according to your needs. This may involve combining both code chunks.
  
4. Add your changes to the commit by running `git add .` in the terminal

5. Commit your changes with a comment:

```{r eval=FALSE}
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict by deleting base code."
```
