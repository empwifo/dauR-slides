# Functional Programming

---

## Functional Languages

- Programming languages with **first-class functions** are called functional languages
  
- First-class functions behave like other data structures, i. e. they can be 

  - Assigned to variables
  - Passed on to other functions as arguments
  - Created inside functions

- Functions are often required to be **pure**, i. e. they satisfy:
  
  - The output is determined by its input so that it always returns the same output given the same input
  - There are no side-effects to a function so that it does not change the global environment, disk or displays output on the screen
  
--

.pull-left.short-width[
.big-emoji[`r emo::ji("warning")`]
]

.pull-right.long-width[
- Not all functions in R are pure (e. g. `rnorm()` generates random numbers from a normal distribution), but they are first-class functions

- Yet, at its core, R is a functional programming language

- Functional style can be adopted by separating pure and non-pure functions
]

---

class: middle

## Functional Style

> It’s hard to describe exactly what a [functional programming] style is, but generally [...] it means **decomposing a big problem into smaller pieces**, then solving each piece with a function or combination of functions.
>
> When using a functional style, you strive to **decompose components of the problem into isolated functions** that operate independently. Each function taken by itself is simple and straightforward to understand; complexity is handled by composing functions in various ways.

## Why use functions in R?

---

.pull-left[
- The code on the right creates a data frame with 50 observations and three variables (`x`, `y`, `z`) drawn from normal distributions $N(\mu,\sigma)$ with $\mu=5$ and $\sqrt\sigma=10$

- Each variable is standardized: $\frac{x-\bar{x}}{\sqrt{\sigma_x}}$

- This approach is bad practice &rarr; copy-pasting code is **prone to errors** and **hard to maintain**

- Does not improve readability and comprehensiveness of the code
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
# Create a data frame with 50 observations
# and 3 normal distributed variables with 
# mean 5 and standard deviation 10
df <- data.frame(x = rnorm(50, 5, 10),
                 y = rnorm(50, 5, 10),
                 z = rnorm(50, 5, 10))
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Standardize each variable
df$x <- (df$x - mean(df$x)) / sd(df$x)
df$y <- (df$y - mean(df$y)) / sd(df$y)
df$z <- (df$z - mean(df$z)) / sd(df$z)
```

]

.pull-left.short-width[
.big-emoji[`r emo::ji("cross mark")`]
]

.pull-right.lo-wi[
#### Do not try at home!
]

---

.pull-left[
- Instead, we can write a function with a proper name that **takes a numeric vector** as input and **returns the standardized vector**

- The function can then be applied to each column of the data frame that we have created in advance

- This function is more **readable** and **comprehensive**

- **Maintaining the code becomes easier** because altering the standardization requires only adjusting the function `standardize()`

- Writing a function should be considered when the same code is repeated several times

- Because R use first-class-functions, it is inherently made for using functional programming
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
standardize <- function(x) {
  mean_x <- mean(x)
  
  sd_x <- sd(x)
  
  (x - mean_x) / sd_x
}
```


```{r eval=FALSE}
df$x <- standardize(df$x)
```

]

---

layout: false

## Function Components

.pull-left[
- There are three key components to functions:
  
  1. The **name** of a function is assigned using the `<-` operator
  2. The function **arguments** are provided in the parentheses of `function()`, separated by commas
  3. The **body** defines what is executed on the arguments and is placed the in curly brackets `{...}` after `function()`
  
- Binding a function to a name is not required &rarr; **anonymous function**

- The return value can be defined using `return()` or simply the last printed object (as in the `standardize()` function)
]

.pull-right[
```{r eval=FALSE}
<NAME> <- function(<ARGUMENTS>) {
  <BODY>
}
```

]

---

layout: true

## Function Arguments

---

.pull-left[
- Function arguments can generally be categorized in
  
  1. the **data** to compute the body on
  2. the **details** of the computation

- Example: `log()` takes `x` as the data argument and the details of the computation are defined by the argument `base`

- Default arguments can be specified in `function()`, e. g. the default value for `base` in `log()` is `exp(1)`
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
log
```
]

---

#### Best Practices

- Data arguments are placed before details arguments

- Default values are set to their most common value (e. g. 0.95 for confidence level)

- Empty spaces around `<-` and `=`

- Match names of arguments in existing R functions for consistency:

  - `x`, `y`, `z`: vectors
  - `w`: weights
  - `df`: data frame
  - `i`, `j`: numeric indices (such as rows and columns)
  - `n`: number of rows (matrices and data frames) or vector length
  - `p`: number of columns (for matrices and data frames)

---

layout: false

## Checking Argument Values

.pull-left[
- It is good practice to check arguments for their validity to avoid the function body to through errors

- Can use `if` statements to check whether values given for arguments satisfy conditions

- If an input does not satisfy these conditions, we can `stop()` the execution of the function early on

- We can pass a string to `stop()` to notify the user of what went wrong

- Example: `x` in our `standardize()` function has to be of type numeric
]
.pull-right[
.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Function]
```{r}
standardize <- function(x) {
  if(!is.numeric(x))
    stop("x has to be numeric")
  
  x_mean <- mean(x)
  
  x_sd <- sd(x)
  
  (x - x_mean) / x_sd
}
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Error]
.scroll-box-14[
```{r error=TRUE}
not_numeric <- c("This",
                 "is",
                 "not", 
                 "numeric")

standardize(not_numeric)
```
]
]
]

]

---

layout: true

## Lexical Scoping

---
.pull-left[
> R [...] looks up the values of names based on how a function is defined, not how it is called.
>
> “Lexical” here is not the English adjective that means relating to words or a vocabulary. It’s a technical CS term that tells us that the scoping rules use a parse-time, rather than a run-time structure.
>
> .right[`r Citet(bib, "advancedr")`]

]

--

.pull-right[
Lexical scoping means that R follows these rules:

1. **Name masking**

2. **Functions over variables**

3. **Independent invocation**

4. **Dynamic lookup**
]

---

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Name Masking]
.pull-left[
- Names defined inside a function mask names outside a function

- If R cannot find a name inside a function, it looks for the name outside the function (e. g. in the global environment)
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
y <- 5

some_function <- function() {
  print(y)
}

some_function()
```

]
]
.panel[.panel-name[Functions over Variables]
.pull-left[
- If a function and a variable residing in different environments share the same name, R chooses the function if the name is called

- Two objects should never be named the same, regardless of this behavior!
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
y_1 <- function(x) x + 5

y_2 <- function() {
  y_1 <- 5
  y_1(y_1)
}

y_2()
```

]
]
.panel[.panel-name[Independent Invocation]
.pull-left[
- Each function call is executed in a new environment

- Names defined during function call are not present, when executing the function call again

- You may have noticed that running `standardized()` in your environment does not create variables `x_mean` and `x_sd`
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
some_function <- function(x) {
  x + 5
}

some_function(5)

some_function(5)
```
]
]
.panel[.panel-name[Dynamic Lookup]
.pull-left[
- R looks for names only when the function is executed, not when it is created

- Reassigning variables that are defined outside the function but called during the function execution, may change the function output
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
some_function <- function() {
  x + 5
}

x <- 10

some_function()

x <- 15

some_function()
```
]
]
]

---

layout: false

## Lazy Evaluation

.pull-left[
- Arguments are only evaluated when they are accessed by R (**lazy evaluation**)

- If an argument of a function is not called inside the function, it is not evaluated by R, potentially saving resources when the evaluation would be computationally expensive

- Allows for defining default arguments in terms of other arguments
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
some_function <- function(x = 5,
                          y = 1,
                          z = x + y) {
  z
}

some_function()
```

]

---

## Ellipsis

.pull-left[
- An **ellipsis** (`...`) is a reserved special argument that captures all arguments not otherwise matched by the function specification

- Useful when writing functions that primarily wrap other functions

- Example: Our `standardize()` wraps around `mean()` and `sd()`

  - If we call `standardize()` on a vector with missing values, `mean()` and `sd()` would throw errors
  - Since both `mean()` and `sd()` take the same argument, we may want to pass these arguments in `standardize()` down to these functions
]
.pull-right[

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Code]
```{r "ellipsis", eval=FALSE}
standardize <- function(x, ...) {
  if(!is.numeric(x))
    stop("x has to be numeric")
  
  x_mean <- mean(x, ...)
  
  x_sd <- sd(x, ...)
  
  (x - x_mean) / x_sd
}

# Create a vector with one NA and two
# random values
vec_na <- c(NA, rnorm(2, 5, 10))

standardize(vec_na, na.rm = TRUE)
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Output]
```{r ref.label="ellipsis", echo=FALSE}

```
]
]

]

---

layout: true

## Apply Functions

---

.pull-left[
- Writing functions is most useful when the execution of their body is needed multiple times in your code

- Example: we want to use `standardize()` on each column of `df`

- We could `for` loop through all columns of `df`
]
.pull-right[
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Number of columns in df
df_ncol <- ncols(df)

# Loop through columns and standardize
for(i in 1:df_ncol) {
  df[,i] <- standardize(df[,i])
}
```
]

--

.pull-left.short-width[
.big-emoji[`r emo::ji("cross mark")`]
]

.pull-right.lo-wi[
A better approach is to use `apply()` on `df`!
]

---

```{r eval=FALSE}
?apply
```
.pull-left[
- `apply()` returns a vector, matrix or list of values returned by applying a function to margins of a matrix

- *Very* useful for applying functions over rows or columns of data frames and matrices

- Takes a matrix `X` as an input and applies a function `FUN` over `MARGIN`

- `MARGIN` specifies whether `FUN` should be applied over rows (`=1`), columns (`=2`) or both (`=c(1, 2)`)

- Since `df` can be coerced to a matrix, we can apply `standardize()` over `MARGIN=2` to obtain a matrix with standardized columns
]
.pull-left[
.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Code]
```{r "apply-1", eval=FALSE}
apply(X = df, MARGIN = 2, FUN = standardize)
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Output]
.scroll-box-16[
```{r ref.label="apply-1", echo=FALSE}

```
]
]
]
]
 
---

layout: false

## Variants of Apply

There are several `*apply()` functions, each tailored to specific requirements for input and output types:

- `lapply(X, FUN, ...)`: applies `FUN` over a list

- `sapply(X, FUN, ..., simplify = TRUE, USE.NAMES = TRUE)`: wrapper of `lapply` that returns a vector or matrix

- `vapply(X, FUN, FUN.VALUE, ..., USE.NAMES = TRUE)`: has a pre-specified type of return value given by `FUN.VALUE`

---

layout: false

## Apply Anonymous Functions

Instead of applying our `standardize()` function, we could have defined an anonymous function inside `apply()` with the same result:

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Code]
```{r "apply-2", eval=FALSE}
apply(df, 2, function(x) (x - mean(x)) / sd(x))
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Output]
.scroll-box-16[
```{r ref.label="apply-2", echo=FALSE}

```
]
]
]

layout: false
class: middle

# Composing Functions

---

## Function Composition

.pull-left[
- In `base` R, multiple functions can be composed by:

  1. Saving intermediate results
  2. Nesting functions
  
- Both approaches are rather flawed

- Saving intermediate results requires assigning function output, eventually floating the environment with many irrelevant objects

- Nesting functions may reduce readability and comprehensiveness of your code

- Example: Applying `standardize()` over columns of `df` returns a matrix. We may want to coerce the resulting matrix back to a data frame using `as.data.frame()`
]
.pull-left[
.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Intermediate Results]
```{r eval=FALSE}
df_std <- apply(df, 2, standardize)
df_std <- as.data.frame(df_std)
```

]
.panel[.panel-name[Nested Functions]
```{r eval=FALSE}
as.data.frame(
  apply(
    df,
    2,
    standardize
  )
)
```

## `magrittr`

> The magrittr package offers a set of operators which make your code more readable by:
>
> - structuring sequences of data operations left-to-right (as opposed to from the inside and out),
>
> - avoiding nested function calls,
>
> - minimizing the need for local variables and function definitions, and
making it easy to add steps anywhere in the sequence of operations.
>
> The operators pipe their left-hand side values forward into expressions that appear on the right-hand side, i.e. one can replace f(x) with x %>% f(), where %>% is the (main) pipe-operator. When coupling several function calls with the pipe-operator, the benefit will become more apparent.
>
> .right[`r Citet(bib, "magrittr")`]

## What are "packages"?

- Packages are bundles of R code, data and documentation that are often shared via the **Comprehensive R Archive Network** (CRAN)

- R packages are often developed by small teams and made available via CRAN for anyone to download (open source)

- To install and load the `magrittr` package on your system, run the code below

- Content from loaded packages is only available in your current session &rarr; if you close and reopen R, you have to run `library(magrittr)` again but **not** have to re-install it

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("magrittr")
library(magrittr)
```

---

## The Pipe-Operator

.pull-left[
- The pipe operator (`%>%`) is **immensely** useful for writing comprehensive code in functional programming style

- `%>%` does what the name implies: It pipes the value on the left side into an expression or function on the right side

- Pipes can be chained, e. g. `x %>% f_1() %>% ... %>% f_n()`

- Functions are sequentially executed on the output of the previous function

- Keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl + Shift + M`

- Example: Pipe `df` through `apply()` and `as.data.frame()`
]
.pull-right[
```{r eval=FALSE}
df %>% 
  apply(2, standardize) %>% 
  as.data.frame
```

]

---

## Features of the Pipe-Operator

1. Left-hand side (LHS) is piped into the right-hand side (RHS) as the first argument of the function

2. `%>%` can be used *inside* functions as well

3. The LHS can be explicitly called with a dot (`.`) if it is needed at a different argument position of the RHS (not to be confused with the dot in R formulas!)

4. Parentheses can be omitted when the LHS needs only a single argument that is at the first position (not recommended)

---

## `r emo::ji("warning")` Base R's Pipe Operator

.pull-left[
- As of version 4.1.0, base R supports the native pipe operator `|>`

- Version 4.2.0 added a placeholder for the LHS (`_`)

  - Works only if the argument is named

- Apart from the naming, this pipe operator essentially works the same as `magrittr`'s pipe operator (at least for simple operations)

- See [this](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2023/04/base-vs-magrittr-pipe/) `tidyverse` blog entry for differences between both

## `purrr`

> `purrr` enhances R’s functional programming (FP) toolkit by providing a complete and consistent set of tools for working with functions and vectors. If you’ve never heard of FP before, the best place to start is the family of `map()` functions which allow you to replace many `for` loops with code that is both more succinct and easier to read.
>
> .right[`r Citet(bib, "purrr")`]

---

## `map()`

```{r eval=FALSE}
?purrr::map
```

Similar to `apply()`, `map()` applies a function over each element of an input list or vector and returns an object of the same length.

- Takes an input `.x` (list or vector) and transforms it using a function `.f`

- Arguments to be passed on to `.f` can be defined after `.f`, separated by commas

- Contrary to `apply()`, `purrr`'s `map_*()` function are type-consistent, e. g. `map()` always returns a list

- There are several variants of `map` that return pre-specified types: `map_int()` (integer), `map_dbl()` (double), `map_chr()` (character), `map_df()` (data frame)

- `walk()` executes `.f` on `.x` but returns `.x` (useful for side-effects of `.f` such as exporting data)

---

## Example: `map_df()`

.pull-left[
- Pipe `df` into `map_df()` to standardize each column and return a data frame with standardized columns

- Anonymous functions can be defined inside `map()` functions

- Lambdas can be used if the LHS should define an argument in the RHS function that is not placed at the first position

- Lambdas behave similar to pipes in that the LHS value is called via `.`

- See `vignette("base")` for more many more handy use cases

## Installation and Use

- Packages included in the `tidyverse` meta package cover a wide range of applications covering almost any task required in data analysis projects:

  - Importing
  - Tidying
  - Transforming
  - Visualizing
  - Programming
  
- Loading the `tidyverse` package automatically loads a set of core packages, commonly used for these tasks (e. g. `magrittr` and `purrr` are part of the core packages)

- Over the course of the semester, you will become familiar with the fundamental packages and concepts of the `tidyverse`

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Install and load the tidyverse
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

---

## Tidyverse Principles

- `tidyverse` packages share a common Application Programming Interface (API), making it easy to follow a consistent programming style, when using its packages

- The tidy API follows these rules:

  1. Reuse existing data structures
  
  2. Compose simple functions with the pipe
  
  3. Embrace functional programming
  
  4. Design for humans

--

- See the [tidy tools manifesto](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/articles/manifesto.html) for more information
  
---

## Reuse Existing Data Structures

- Existing data structures are re-used whenever possible

- Common data structures are **easier for users to get accustomed to** than special-purpose structures

- R is mainly for statistical programming: Many packages work with rectangular data with observations as rows and variables as columns &rarr; using the `base` R data structure for rectangular data

- For lower level data structures such as vectors, use `base` R's atomic vector structure

---

## Compose Simple Functions with the Pipe

- Reduce complex problems to simple tasks that can be chained

- Keep functions as simple as possible (but not too simple)

  - **Each function** should achieve **one task**
  
  - Rule of thumb: You should be able to explain the goal of your function in one sentence

- Avoid mixing side-effects and transformations: Each function should either transform an input and return the output *or* be used for their side effect

- Define function names as verbs (they *do* something)

---

## Embrace Functional Programming

- Use what R is made for: Functions!

- Focus on immutable objects and copy-on-modify semantics

- Use `apply` or `purrr`'s `map` functions instead of loops and copy-pasting code

---

## Design for Humans

- In the end, your **code must be written, read and understood by humans**

- Computer efficiency is not as important in data analysis as the main portion of your analysis is spent on thinking about *how* to solve your problem

- Follow a **consistent naming** scheme for your functions

- Use explicit and descriptive names so that you can still follow your code if you come back to it later

- Let objects of a family of objects be identified by a common prefix not suffix (helps with autocomplete when writing code)

# Style Guide

## The Tidyverse Style Guide

- This course mostly follows the coding style proposed by `r Citet(bib, "styleguide")`

- Note that this style guide reflects *opinions* on how good code should look like

- Many of these style decisions, however, do make your code easier to write, read and understand

- Most importantly, your code should follow a consistent style!

## Files

.pull-left[
#### Names

- Name your files meaningfully and in lower case
- Use `-` or `_` to separate words
- If files are run in sequential order, use numbers as prefixes (that way files are properly ordered in the explorer)

#### Organisation

- Organize files in folders
- Give concise and descriptive names to folders
- Store scripts where only functions are defined in a folder called "R"
- Complex functions should be stored in separate files
]
.pull-right[
```{r eval=FALSE}

## Internal File Structure

.pull-left[
- Load packages at the top of your R scripts

- Indicate sections with `#`

  - If your sections have subsections, indicate them with one more `##`
  - First level section `#`, second level section `##`, ...
  - Write `####` at the end of the line to let R know that this is a code section
  - This way, when you open the file outline (`Ctrl + Shift + O`), you can see a table of contents for your script

- Write `#` followed by underscores up until `####` before a new section to create separation lines between sections (makes the ToC more readable)

## Syntax

---

.pull-left[
#### Object Names

- Use **snake case** for variable and function names: Separate words within a name with an underscore (`_`)

- Variable names should be nouns and function names should be verbs

- Do not re-use names of other functions

- Give objects of the same family a common prefix

- Be descriptive with the names you choose (even if they may be longer)
]
.pull-right[
```{r "syntax", eval=FALSE}
x <- rnorm(50, 0, 1)

standardize <- function(x, na.rm = TRUE) {
  if(!is.numeric(x))
    stop("x has to be numeric")
  
  x_mean <- mean(x, na.rm = na.rm)
  
  x_sd <- sd(x, na.rm = na.rm)
  
  (x - x_mean) / x_sd
}

x_std <- standardize(x, na.rm = TRUE)
```

]

---

.pull-left[
#### Spacing

- Always put an empty space after a comma, not before!

- Do not put spaces inside/outside parentheses of functions

- Place a space after closing parentheses

- Surround infix operators (`=`, `+`, `<-`, ...) by spaces

.pull-left.short-width[
.big-emoji[`r emo::ji("warning")`]
]

.pull-right.lo-wi2[
Do not surround `::`, `:::`, `$`, `@`, `?`, `^` and the subsetting operators by spaces!
]
]
.pull-right[
```{r ref.label="syntax", eval=FALSE}

```

]

---

.pull-left[
#### Function Calls


- Provide names for **detail** arguments when you call a function

- Names for **data** arguments may be omitted when they are used frequently

- Re-use existing data and detail argument names where appropriate

- Do not use `<-` inside function arguments

- Place the function body in the next line after `{` and indent its code

- Only use `return()` for early function exits
]
.pull-right[
```{r ref.label="syntax", eval=FALSE}

```

]

---

.pull-left[
#### Control Flow

- Separate `if` and its statement with a space

- Place the body in a new line after `{` and indent it (two spaces/`Tab`)

- Short control flow content may be placed in the same line (or the following without curly brackets)

- If `else` is used, it should be on the same line as the closing `}` of the `if` statement

- Very short `if`-`else` controls may be placed in the same line
]
.pull-right[
```{r eval=FALSE}
if (x > 0) {
  x_ln <- log(x)
} else {
  message("x is 0 or smaller")
}

if (x <= 0) "not positive" else "positive"
```

]

---

.pull-left[
#### Limit Long Lines

- If a code line does not fit your script width (indicated by the vertical line on the right), place function arguments in new lines

- Each argument should be in a separate line

- Omit argument names, when they are used commonly

- When omitting argument names, unnamed arguments may be place in the first line of the function even if the named arguments are in separate lines

.pull-right[
```{r eval=FALSE}
some_long_function(x,
                   argument_1 = c(1, 2),

some_longer_almost_too_long_function(
  x,
  argument_1 = c(1, 2),
  argument_2 = TRUE
)
```

]

---

.pull-left[
#### Assignment

Use `<-` **not** `=` to assign variables and functions!
]
.pull-right[
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Do this
x <- rnorm(50, 5, 10)

# Not this
x = rnorm(50, 5, 10)
```

]

--

.pull-left[
#### Character

- Start characters with `"`
- Use `'` for quotations inside strings
]
.pull-right[
```{r eval=FALSE}
chr <- "Experiment 'A'"
```
]

---

#### Comments

- Comments should start with `#` and single space

- Be concise and descriptive with comments

- Clean and readable code should reduce your need for writing comments

- Explain *why* you do something not *what* and *how*
