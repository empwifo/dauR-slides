## Introduction

.left.overlap-lr-width[
It is quite common to perform data analyses and communicate the results in a separate document that...
]

--

.pull-right.overlap-lr-width[
... has to be updated manually whenever results change.
]

--

.pull-right.overlap-lr-width[
... is usually not version-controlled.
]

--

.pull-right.overlap-lr-width[
... is, unfortunately, oftentimes a rather poorly formatted MS Office document.

## Quarto

[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is an open-source tool developed by [Posit](https://posit.co/) (the developers behind, among others, RStudio and the `tidyverse`) that builds on the popular universal document converter [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and allows for:

- Creating dynamic documents and web-content with R (and Python, Julia and Observable)

- Writing reports as plain text markdown

- Compiling reports to PDF, HTML, MS Word and more

- Scientific notations, display of complex equations, automatically formatted citations, cross-referencing and more

To get started, download the newest Quarto version [here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

---

## Installing TinyTeX

- For compiling reports to PDF, a TeX distribution is needed on your device

- It is recommended to use [TinyTeX](https://yihui.org/tinytex/) that is targeted primarily at R users

- Quarto offers a built-in function to install TinyTeX to your system

- Type the following command in the RStudio terminal:

```{r eval=FALSE}
quarto install tinytex
```

---

## Creating a Quarto Document

.pull-left[
- Click on `File > New File > Quarto Document...` to create a Quarto document

- Provide document title, author and output format now (or define it later)

- Uncheck the box for the visual editor
]
.pull-right[
```{r  out.width = "90%", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(params$path_assets, "new_quarto.png")) 
```
]

---

## Structure of Quarto Documents

A Quarto document consists of...

--

.pull-left[
... a YAML header

```{r eval=FALSE}
---
title: "Border Fences and Migration"
subtitle: "Replication of Feigenberg (2020)"
author: "Sven Werenbeck-Ueding"
format: beamer
---
```
]

--

.pull-right[
... a document body

```
## Introduction

- Limited literature on changing migration costs
- Exogenous shocks are hard to identify
- Often impacted by macroeconomic factors affecting
  - Allocation of government resources
  - Labor market opportunities for migrants
```
]

---

## Rendering Quarto Documents

.pull-left[
- Click on the blue arrow labeled "Render"

- Or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+K`

- File needs to be saved before being able to render
]
.pull-right[
```{r  out.width = "90%", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(params$path_assets, "render_quarto.png")) 
```
]

---

## How does it work?

When clicking on rendering (or using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+K`), [`knitr`](https://yihui.org/knitr/) executes the code contained in the file and generates a markdown document (.md) that includes the code and its output along with the markdown text in the Quarto document.

Pandoc then processes the markdown file to the format defined in the YAML header.

![](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/images/rstudio-qmd-how-it-works.png)

.right[`r Citet(bib, "quartotutorial")`]

---

## YAML Header

.pull-left[
- Placed at the top and specifies metadata and customization options of the document
- Begins and ends with three dashes (`---`)
- Given by key-value pairs in the format `key: value`
- The output format can be defined with the `format` key
  - `format: pdf` for PDF documents
  - `format: beamer` for LaTeX-based PDF presentations
  - We will focus on creating beamer presentations
- Setting `editor` to `source` let's RStudio open the file as raw source text
- For a full list of YAML fields for beamer presentations, see [here](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/presentations/beamer.html)
]

## Code Chunks

.pull-left[
- The huge benefit of using Quarto is to be able to compile code when rendering the document

- R code chunks begin with three backticks (`r "\x60"`) and `r "{r}"` and ends with three backticks

- Optional chunk options can be specified using the YAML key-value pair format `key: value` beginning with `#|` in the line after the beginning of the chunk

- Code inside the chunk is executed when rendering the document
]
.pull-right[
.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Markdown]

````{verbatim}

```{r}
#| label: mpg_summary

## Useful Chunk Options

| Key           | Values         | Description                                         |
| ------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `eval`        | `true`/`false` | Controls whether or not the code should be compiled. |
| `echo`        | `true`/`false` | Controls whether or not the source code should be included in the rendered document. |
| `message`     | `true`/`false` | Controls whether or not code messages should be included in the rendered document. |
| `warning`     | `true`/`false` | Controls whether or not code warnings should be included in the rendered document. |

- Default chunk options can be set for the whole document in the YAML header
]

---

## Creating Beamer Slides

.pull-left[
- Slide titles are defined by two hashtags (`##`)

- To create slides without a title, separate the slides with three dashes (`---`)

- Comment your Quarto document with `%`

- Slides can be divided into sections using a single hashtag (`#`)
  
*Note:* There should be no text, code chunk or comment between section title and slide title!
]

.pull-right[
````{verbatim}
---
title: "Some Title for a Research Project"
format: beamer
editor: source

# First section

## Title of the first slide

% This is some comment that is not rendered

This is the slide body

---

This is a slide without title
but with code chunk

```{r}
plot(mtcars$hp ~ mtcars$mpg)
```
````
]

---

## Writing Text

- Text in Quarto documents is written in markdown syntax

- Markdown is a leightweight syntax used for adding formatting of plain texts

- When `format` is `pdf` or `beamer`, LaTeX expressions can be used as if one would write a LaTeX document

- Markdown expressions can be used to define section headers, italic text, bold text, bullet points, enumerations, and more

- Different from e. g. MS Word, where text formatting has to be added by clicking on the respective elements in the user interface

---

## Emphasize Text

.pull-left[
- *Italic*: Surround text with single asterisks `*`

- **Bold**: Surround text with two asterisks `**`

- ~~Strikethrough~~: Surround text with two tildes `~~`

- ***Combine emphasis*** of text by surrounding it with three asterisks `***`
]

.pull-right[
````{verbatim}
---
title: "Some Title for a Research Project"
format: beamer
editor: source
---

## Some slide title

This is *italic*

This is **bold**

This is ~~striked through~~

This is ***bold and italic***
````
]

---

## Lists

.pull-left[
- Lists with Bullet point can be created by beginning a line with a dash (`-`)

- Enumerations can be created by beginning a line with a digit followed by a dot (e. g. `1.`)

- To create nested lists, indent the bullet points

*Note:* Lists have to be separated from paragraphs by an empty line!
]

.pull-right[
````{verbatim}
---
title: "Some Title for a Research Project"
format: beamer
editor: source
---

## Some slide title

Be sure to separate paragraph and list by
an empty line!

- First bullet point
  - Bullet point with indent
  - Another bullet point
- Another first-level bullet point
- ...

1. First element of an ordered list
2. Second element
3. ...
````
]

---

## Equations

- Equations in inline math mode can be written by surrounding the equation by dollar signs (`$`), e. g. `$y_i=X_i\beta+\varepsilon_i$` renders to $y_i=X_i\beta+\varepsilon_i$

- Equations in display math mode can be written by surrounding the equation by two dollar signs (`$$`), e. g. surrounding the equation above with two dollar signs on each side renders to $$y_i=X_i\beta+\varepsilon_i$$

- For more information on how to write equations, see the documentation on mathematical expressions in LaTeX on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Mathematical_expressions)

## Figures

.pull-left[
- Figures can be included using

.center[
`![<fig-caption>](<fig-path>){<attributes>}`
]

- Resizing is done by either providing `width` or `height` in the figure attributes

  - Add `width=50%` in the curly brackets to resize the width to 50% of the original figure width
  
  - Can also specify pixels or inches
  
  - Height is then chosen automatically
  
  - Could also provide only height or both
  
- Alignment can be changed using the `fig-align` attribute ("left", "center", "right")

- Multiple attributes are seperated by a white space only (no comma!)

layout: false

## Cross-Referencing Figures

- Use `#fig-<reference_ID>` in the attributes to add a cross-reference ID to figures

- Throughout the document, you can simply write `@fig-<reference_ID>` to reference the corresponding figure

- Be sure to add the prefix `fig-`!

---

layout: false

## Figures from URL

We can also include a figure from an URL by giving the link to the figure in the parentheses:

.pull-left[

```{verbatim}
![](https://media.giphy.com/media/CuMiNoTRz2bYc/giphy.gif)
```

]
.pull-right[
.center[
![](https://media.giphy.com/media/CuMiNoTRz2bYc/giphy.gif)
]
]

---

## Linked Figures

To link figures, simply enclose the figure within a link, i. e. `[![](<figure-path>)](<url>)`:

.pull-left[

```{verbatim}
[![](https://media.giphy.com/media/CuMiNoTRz2bYc/giphy.gif)](https://media.giphy.com/media/CuMiNoTRz2bYc/giphy.gif)

---

layout: false

## Figures from Code

.pull-left[
- Figures from code chunks are automatically inserted

- To add a reference ID, caption and/or link, specify the chunk options `label`, `fig-cap` or `fig-link`

- The size of the figure can be controlled via `fig-width`/`fig-height`

- See the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html#figure-options) for more options

- If your code creates multiple plots, these can be shown in a subfigure environment with a panel layout (see the Quarto documentation [here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html#computations))

## Tables in R

- Many packages offer functions for exporting tables in different formats

- An easy to use function resides in the `knitr` package: `kable()`

--

.pull-left[
> The `kable()` function in knitr is a very simple table generator, and is simple by design. It only generates tables for strictly rectangular data such as matrices and data frames. You cannot heavily format the table cells or merge cells. However, this function does have a large number of arguments for you to customize the appearance of tables.
>
> .right[`r Citet(bib, "rmarkdown-cookbook")`]
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r eval=FALSE}
kable(
  x,              # matrix or data.frame
  format,         # e. g. "latex" or "html"
  digits = getOption("digits"),
  row.names = NA,
  col.names = NA,
  align,          # Column alignment
  caption = NULL,
  label = NULL,   # reference label
  format.args = list(),
  escape = TRUE,
  ...
)
```

]

--

- If `format` is left out, the appropriate format will be chosen by `knitr`'s global option `knitr.table.format`, when rendering the document

---

## Example: Summary Statistics

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Task]
For the `mtcars` data set, calculate the mean and standard deviation of

- horse power (`hp`),

- gas consumption (`mpg`), and

- acceleration (`qsec`)

for each category of cylinders (`cyl`).

## Package Features

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# install.packages("kableExtra")
library(kableExtra)
```

- `kableExtra` does not change the way how tables are generated using `kable`

- Adds convenient functions for customizing a table
  
  - `group_rows()`
  - `footnote()`
  - `add_header_above()`
  - `kable_styling()`
  - ...

- Functions can be piped and usually support both HTMl and PDF format

- Replaced `kable()` with `kbl()` to generate the table (better documentation and format detection)

  - Includes the `booktab` argument which enables the `booktab` format from the corresponding LaTeX package (highly recommend)
  
- See the [documentation](https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/) for more information

---

## Example: Customized Summary Statistics Table

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Task]
Add further customization to the table created before using the `kableExtra` package. For this, add

- a header to group the columns by their respective cylinder category and

- footnote below the table.

*Hint:* Use `kableExtra`'s `add_header_above()` and `footnote()` functions.
]
.panel[.panel-name[Code]
```{r example_3, eval=FALSE}
df_sum_stats %>% 
  mutate(
    metric = case_when(
      metric == "hp" ~ "Horse Power",
      metric == "mpg" ~ "Miles per Gallon",
      metric == "qsec" ~ "1/4 Mile in sec." 
    )
  ) %>%

## Tables in Quarto

- Quarto allows for convenient compilation of tables, enabling the author to

  - Specify column alignment and widths

  - Provide captions, subcaptions, and cross-references

  - Generate tables dynamically from code chunks
  
- Options can be added in the respective code chunk

  - `label` for cross-referencing
  - `tbl-cap` for table captions
  - ...

- For cross-references, add the `tbl-` prefix to your reference, e. g. `@tbl-sum_stats`

- See the [documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/tables.html) for more information

---

## Bibliography

Quarto uses Pandoc to automatically generate citations and a bibliography from citations provided in the document and a bibliographic data source (such as BibLaTex files) referenced in the YAML header:

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[YAML]
.pull-left[
- The bibliographic data source is defined in the `bibliography` key

- If the bibliography does not reside in the same directory as the Quarto document, the path has to be adjusted accordingly

- You can set the citation method and bibliography style manually if necessary. For further information see [here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html#sec-biblatex)

## Citations

.pull-left[
- Citations must have a key consisting of `@` and the citation identifier in the bibliography file

- Multiple citations in parantheses must be separated by semicolons

- You can also write inside squared parantheses if, for example, you want to add "see" before the citation

- For a consistent naming of citation identifiers, I recommend to use the first letter of the authors last name and the year of publication, e. g. Feigenberg (2020) &rarr; `f20`

## References Slide

.pull-left[
- Pandoc automatically generates a references slide at the end of the document

- If the user provides a `div` with the reference `{#refs}`, the bibliography will be placed there instead

- To keep more control over the bibliography slide(s), add the markdown text on the right to the end of your document

- To allow automatic slide breaks in the references (if you have many citations in the bibliography spanning multiple slides), simply add `{.allowframebreaks}` to the slide header

- Data was taken from the mtcars data set that comes with R

- Gas consumption of cars decreases with horsepower

- Some further insights from the figure

## Adjusting Themes

.pull-left[
- Beamer themes are generally not that aesthetically pleasent

- You may want to tweak the colors of your chosen theme

- This can be done by referencing a LaTeX file (.tex) in the YAML header key `include-in-header` of the beamer format

- Quarto puts the content of that file in the header, i. e. before the document body begins, when rendering the LaTeX output

- You can find an example for a custom theme in the repository of this course
